        <p>Ataxia was formed after John and Josh played two experimental shows at Knitting Factory in early 2004. They planned two more similar performances and asked Joe to join them and play bass.<br><br>
        The original plan was to play existing songs from John's solo catalogue. <span class="terracotta">However, the trio decided to rather write new material from scratch.</span> This was partly due to a desire to do something more spontaneous, as well as due to Joe not feeling comfortable with trying to learn that many songs on such short notice.</p>

        <p>The band then began writing, rehearsing and recording these ten new songs comprising about 80 minutes of music. <span class="terracotta">This entire process was lightning-fast (in true punk rock fashion) and only took two weeks.</span> Five of those songs were released on <em>Automatic Writing</em> on the 10th of August 2004 with "Dust" as the opener. The remainder of the tracks were released on an EP called <em>AWII</em> in 2007.<br><br>
        These sessions were recorded in a live band setting with minimal overdubbing and added electronic treatments. The members shared vocal and lyric-writing duties. Josh sang on "Another", Joe on "Montreal" and John on the other three songs.</p>
