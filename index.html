        <p>This is a small collection of web projects exploring the mobile first strategy and responsive design.</p>

        <p>I built them with the intention of practising grid layouts and the art of writing clean code.</p>

        <p>These three projects are each based on and inspired by a song. My goal was to create a design for each one that evokes the atmosphere and spirit of the chosen song as much as possible. In all three I used the lyrics as a key feature. I also included pictures which complement the mood of the song as well as relevant information about the album and artist in question.</p>

        <p>I hope you enjoy what I have created.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
