        <p>"Stars" is the opening track on the debut EP
        <em>Exquisite Corpse</em> by the band Warpaint. It is one of the very first songs that the band ever wrote. <em>Exquisite
        Corpse</em> was recorded in roughly two months. The EP was self-released by the band in August 2008. The EP was
        subsequently re-released worldwide by the record label Manimal Vinyl
        on the 6th of October 2009.<br><br>
        The engineer and producer of the EP was Jacob Bercovici while mixing was done by Adam Samuels and additional mixing and mastering were performed by John Frusciante. Frusciante also played mellotron on the song "Billie Holiday" although this detail was not included in the liner notes.</p>
